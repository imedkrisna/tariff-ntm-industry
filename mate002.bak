# What is this repo?
 files needed to reproduce my paper. I do not upload the needed data here, however, since it is too much size and some of my data is restricted.

 Be wary that this isn't the best practice of coding so please sorry if the code is too WET for your taste.

# What to run?
 just run the final2015.do to reproduce data on the paper.

# File is needed but do not exist here
 1. survey industry data which I call 'paper2si.dta'. This is not an open access data.
 1. customs data on a folder i call 'bc'. This is not an open access data.
 1. a folder called 'NTM' because it contains data from 'bc'.
 1. gravity data i call 'grav.dta' because it is quite big in size. It can be easily downloaded from [CEPII](http://www.cepii.fr/cepii/en/bdd_modele/presentation.asp?id=8).
 1. a folder called 'trains' because it is quite big in size. It can be easily downloaded from [TRAINS UNCTAD](https://trains.unctad.org/Forms/Analysis.aspx)
 
# what are these do-files do?
 1. prepsi is a preparation to make the rough SI dataset workable. generates "sibener.dta"
 1. ntm2015 to prepare the NTM datase "imntm.dta"
 1. prepul to include tariff.
 1. coverage constructs coverage ratio.
 1. tfpregen makes the `levpet` and adds TFP to the dataset.
 1. coveragereg does the second stage regression.
 1. final2015 does PPML.
 1. graph makes k,n comparison graphs.

# Caveat
 There might be changes I haven't updated after many conferences and peer-reviews so be careful.
